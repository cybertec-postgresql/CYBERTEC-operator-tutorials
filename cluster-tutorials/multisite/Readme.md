# Important note on the multisite cluster

The cluster manifest alone is not sufficient to set up a multisite cluster correctly. Additional configuration steps are required, which are described in the documentation.

**Please consult the complete documentation at the following URL before proceeding with the setup:**

[Multisite cluster documentation](https://cybertec-postgresql.github.io/CYBERTEC-pg-operator/multisite/)

> Without considering the further configuration steps, malfunctions or unexpected behaviour may occur in the cluster.
